          My 4th year capstone project at UBC involved building an AI web application, focusing on delivering financial advice to users. We build this project for <a class="underline text-blue-500" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidosemwegie/?originalSubdomain=ca">ClearJar</a>, a startup company run by a recent UBC graduate. The goal was create a chatbot that can answer user specific questions about the user's finances. It tried to replicate the experience and advice someone would get by visiting their own financial assistant.
        </p>
        <p>There are many levels to this project. First we used a <a class="underline text-blue-500" href="https://www.pinecone.io/">vector database</a> to classify different types of transactional data based on semantic meaning. For example, when searching for data, a "coffee" and a "tea" would be close by in the 3D vector space. Then, we managed bank connections through <a class="underline text-blue-500" href="https://plaid.com/">Plaid</a>, an external API service. Finally, we used <a class="underline text-blue-500" href="https://ai.google.dev/">Gemini</a>, Google's AI model, to answer the user's question, based on data retrieved through plaid and Pinecone.</p>
        <p>Our results weren't always consistent due to many factors, including our own algorithms and AI hallucination, but overall we had excellent results when interacting with our chatbot.</p>
        <p>Here are some screenshots of the application</p>

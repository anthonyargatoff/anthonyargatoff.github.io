          I took a software maintenance course during my final year at UBC. This
          course involved working on an existing codebase, this codebase I
          inherited from a previous capstone group project. The application aims
          to improve department management, and is currently in use today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The project uses the
          <a class="underline text-blue-500" href="https://laravel.com/"
            >Laravel</a
          >
          framework, which is PHP based. My time was spent between bug fixes,
          adding features, database migrations, code refactoring, documentation,
          and testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          A significant modification was to alter the database structure so that
          we could store historic course and instructor records. This migration
          created a lot of problems in the application. So, after I completed
          the migration, I began fixing the rest of the application, so that it
          used the new database relations.

        <p>Below are some pictures, and some commentary.</p>
        <p>
          When I first started, each instance of a table had some sort of
          different, inconsistent styling, which happens when 5 people are
          working on the same project. I've created a consistent styling between
          them with re-usable
          <a
            class="text-blue-500 underline"
            href="https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/blade#components"
            >blade components</a
          >.

        <img src="/images/department2.png" alt="department2" />
        <p>
          After the database migration, I created a new page to view course
          details.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/department3.png" alt="dept3" />
        <p>
          I heavily modified the instructor dashboard. It showcases archived and
          non-archived data entries, with nice charts at the bottom.
